Road Safety Inventory and Accident Impact Mitigation System
Description:
This project aims to develop an advanced road safety system hosted on GitHub. The system is designed to identify and monitor a 5-kilometer radius around areas where accidents have occurred. Its primary objective is to reduce the risk of subsequent accidents and enhance safety in low-visibility conditions, such as during fog or heavy rain.

The system employs radio wave communication to alert nearby vehicles about potential hazards in real-time. By disseminating timely warnings, it ensures that drivers are informed about accident-prone zones, thereby enabling them to take precautionary measures. This technology seeks to improve overall road safety and mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions on driver visibility and response times.

Key Features:

Accident detection and hazard zone mapping within a 5-kilometer radius.
Real-time communication with nearby vehicles via radio waves.
Effective in low-visibility environments such as fog, rain, or darkness.
Designed to proactively reduce the risk of accidents and enhance driver safety.
